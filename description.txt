=> In this project we have two main aims:
     1. To minimize evacuation time based on the rate that the smoke/gas spreads
     
     2. To indicate an optimum no. of ppl per exit to reduce the chances 
        of a stampede and keep the time required to a minimum without exposing 
        ppl neer the exits to where the hazard has started to any smoke/gas.
        
   >> This meant that there was only a certain safe time frame in 
      which people can use a said exit.
      
   >> This info was used to find out the maximum people who can exit the building
      absoluely safely based on how far the exits are from the triggered sensor 
      and the exit width.
  
 
 
=> In the Keypad: 
    People would enter a '*' and the number of ppl exiting OR a '#' and the 
    number of ppl entering to log it in the system which calculates the building population.
    
    NOTE: This does not apply after the alarm goes off, 
    pplCount becomes static once the alarm is triggered.

 
=> Accuracy of our optimization algorithm:
  
  We tested our algorithm out 10-12 times with different values and compared our results 
  with official GRG Non Linear Solver on excel that uses an advanced derivative 
  based computing technique.
  
  Every time, our results came out within +- 0.6% of the GRG results, 
  hence verifying our accuracy to a certin extent.
  
  Here's one of the result tables for reference. 
  (pplCount: 800, building info same as the example in this code, sensor triggered: sensor 1)
